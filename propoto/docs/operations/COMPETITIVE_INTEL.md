| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already use PandaDoc" | "Perfect. Propoto generates the content, you send via PandaDoc. Export your proposal and upload — best of both worlds." |
| "PandaDoc has AI now" | "Their AI helps with basic writing. Propoto researches your prospect's website, uses a proven sales framework, and creates visual decks automatically. Generate a proposal in both and compare." |

---

## 3. Indirect Competitors

### 3.1 ChatGPT / Claude

**The Threat:** Free AI can generate proposal content.

**Why We Win:**
| ChatGPT | Propoto |
|---------|---------|
| Generic output | Personalized to prospect |
| Copy-paste workflow | One-click generation |
| No visual output | Auto-generated deck |
| No memory | Learns brand voice |
| No structure | Proven sales framework |

**Positioning:**
> "ChatGPT is a blank page. Propoto is a proposal machine. You could also fly by building your own plane, but most people prefer to buy a ticket."

---

### 3.2 Jasper / Copy.ai

**The Threat:** AI writing tools with templates.

**Why We Win:**
| Jasper | Propoto |
|--------|---------|
| Generic content | Prospect-specific |
| No research | Scrapes their website |
| No visual output | Gamma deck included |
| Monthly word limits | Proposal-based pricing |
| General purpose | Purpose-built for proposals |

**Positioning:**
> "Jasper writes words. Propoto wins deals. We're not a writing tool — we're a sales tool that happens to write."

---

### 3.3 Gamma

**The Threat:** AI presentation tool we depend on.

**Why We Win (For Now):**
| Gamma Alone | Propoto + Gamma |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Presentation only | Proposal + presentation |
| Manual input | Automated research |
| General purpose | Sales-optimized |
| No methodology | Trojan Horse framework |

**Risk:** Gamma could add proposal features.

**Mitigation:** 
- Build relationship with Gamma team
- Prepare Puppeteer fallback
- Focus on sales methodology as moat
