## 1. Pricing Philosophy

**Principle:** Price on value delivered, not cost to serve.

**The Value Equation:**
- Agency proposal time: 4.5 hours
- Agency hourly rate: $150
- Cost per proposal: $675
- Propoto saves: $660 per proposal
- At 15 proposals/month: **$9,900/month saved**

**Pricing Target:** Capture 2-5% of value delivered = $200-500/month

## 3. Pricing Rationale

### 3.1 Why These Price Points?

**$99 Starter:**
- Psychological barrier low enough for impulse
- Still captures solo consultants
- ROI clear at 2 proposals/month

**$199 Growth:**
- Sweet spot for small agency budgets
- Comparable to Qwilr ($35/mo) + tool stack
- ROI clear at 3 proposals/month
- Most customers will land here (target tier)

**$399 Agency:**
- Signals "this is for serious teams"
- Unlimited removes usage anxiety
- Team features justify jump
- ROI clear at 5 proposals/month

### 3.2 Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Price | How We Compare |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| PandaDoc | $49-119/mo | We're cheaper for core use case |
| Qwilr | $35-79/mo | We include AI + decks |
| Proposify | $49-129/mo | We're more powerful |
| ChatGPT Pro | $20/mo | We're structured + integrated |
| Jasper | $49-125/mo | We're proposal-specific |

**Positioning:** Premium price, premium value. Not the cheapest, but the best ROI.

### 3.3 Price Sensitivity Testing

From customer interviews (n=15):

| Price Point | % Would Pay | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| $49/mo | 90% | "Too cheap, what's the catch?" |
| $99/mo | 80% | "No-brainer" |
| $199/mo | 60% | "If it works" |
| $299/mo | 40% | "Need to see results first" |
| $499/mo | 15% | "Enterprise only" |

**Conclusion:** $199 is the optimal entry price for Growth tier.

## 4. Free Trial Strategy

### 4.1 Trial Structure

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Length | 14 days | Long enough to see value, short enough for urgency |
| Proposals | 10 | Enough to test thoroughly |
| Features | Growth tier | Show full value |
| Credit card | Not required | Remove friction |

### 4.2 Trial-to-Paid Conversion Funnel

```
Trial Start → First Proposal → 3+ Proposals → Payment Wall
              (Day 1)          (Day 3-5)       (Day 14)
```

**Conversion Targets:**
- Trial → First Proposal: 80%
- First Proposal → Activation (3+): 50%
- Activation → Paid: 30%
- **Overall Trial → Paid: 12-15%**

### 4.3 Trial Nurture Sequence

| Day | Action | Goal |
|-----|--------|------|
| 0 | Welcome email + quick start | First proposal |
| 1 | "Did you generate your first proposal?" | Activation |
| 3 | Feature highlight (templates) | Engagement |
| 5 | Case study | Social proof |
| 7 | Check-in (personal) | Relationship |
| 10 | "Trial halfway — here's what you've done" | Progress |
| 12 | "2 days left" | Urgency |
| 14 | "Trial ending — special offer" | Conversion |

## 5. Discount Strategy

### 5.1 Approved Discounts

| Comp accounts | Hard to revoke |

### 5.3 When to Offer Discounts

**Do offer:**

- Winning back churned customers
- Strategic partnerships

## 9. Pricing Communication

### 9.1 Pricing Page Copy

**Headline:** "Plans that scale with your agency"

**Subhead:** "Start free. Upgrade when you're ready."

**Trust Elements:**
- "14-day free trial, no credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "30-day money-back guarantee"

### 9.2 Handling Pricing Questions

**"Why is it more expensive than X?"**
> "Great question. Unlike [X], Propoto generates the entire proposal AND creates a visual deck automatically. Most agencies save 4+ hours per proposal. At your rate, that's $600 in savings per proposal. $199/month pays for itself with your first proposal."

**"Can I get a discount?"**
> "Our pricing is designed to be fair and straightforward. The best way to save is to go annual — you'll get 20% off. For $159/month, you're getting unlimited proposals with your whole team."

**"Is there a free plan?"**
> "We have a 14-day free trial with 10 proposals — enough to really test the value. After that, most agencies find the Growth plan ($199/mo) pays for itself in the first week."

## 10. Pricing Review Cadence

| Review | Frequency | Focus |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Win/loss analysis | Monthly | Why people don't convert |
| Competitive pricing | Quarterly | Market positioning |
| Package optimization | Quarterly | Feature allocation |
| Price increase | Annually | Value capture |

**Price Increase Strategy:**
- Grandfather existing customers for 12 months
- 30-day notice minimum
- Offer annual lock-in at old price
- Never more than 20% increase at once
