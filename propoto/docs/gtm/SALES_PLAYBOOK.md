## 1. Sales Philosophy

**We don't sell software. We sell time back.**

Every agency owner we talk to is drowning in proposal work. Our job is to show them there's a better way — in 60 seconds.

**The Propoto Way:**
- Demo first, pitch later
- Show, don't tell
- Value before ask
- Speed is the product, speed is the sale

## 3. The Demo

### 3.1 Demo Structure (15 minutes)

| Time | Section | Goal |
|------|---------|------|
| 0-2 min | **Hook** | Show the magic (generate proposal live) |
| 2-5 min | **Discovery** | Understand their pain |
| 5-10 min | **Walkthrough** | Show features that solve their pain |
| 10-12 min | **ROI** | Quantify the value |
| 12-15 min | **Close** | Get commitment to trial |

### 3.2 The Hook (First 2 Minutes)

**DO NOT START WITH SLIDES.**

Start by sharing your screen and saying:

> "Before I tell you about Propoto, let me show you. Give me a prospect you're working on right now — just their website URL."

Then generate a proposal live. Watch their face. That's the sale.

**Script:**
```
"What's a company you're trying to win right now?"
[They give you a name]

"Perfect. Let me pull up their website..."
[Enter URL, pain points]

"Watch this."
[Click generate, wait 10 seconds]

"There's the proposal. And here's the deck."
[Show Gamma presentation]

"That took 47 seconds. How long does that usually take you?"
[They say 3-5 hours]

"Right. That's what we fix."
```

### 3.3 Discovery Questions

After the hook, dig into their pain:

**Current State:**
- "How many proposals do you send per month?"
- "Who writes them? How long does it take?"
- "What's your close rate on proposals?"

**Pain:**
- "What's the most frustrating part of the proposal process?"
- "Have you lost deals because you couldn't respond fast enough?"
- "How much revenue do you think you've lost to slow proposals?"

**Desired State:**
- "If you could get proposals out in under a minute, what would that mean for your pipeline?"
- "What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"

### 3.4 ROI Calculator

Help them see the value in dollars:

```
Current proposal time: 4 hours
Your hourly rate: $150
Cost per proposal: $600

Proposals per month: 15
Monthly proposal cost: $9,000

With Propoto:
Time per proposal: 5 minutes (including review)
Cost per proposal: $12.50
Monthly proposal cost: $187.50

MONTHLY SAVINGS: $8,812
ANNUAL SAVINGS: $105,750

Propoto cost: $199/month
ROI: 44x
```

**Say:** "For $199/month, you're saving over $8,000. That's a 44x return. When was the last time you saw that ROI on a tool?"

## 4. Objection Handling

### 4.1 Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I hear you. Let me ask — how much time do you spend on proposals each month? [They answer]. At your rate, that's probably $5-10K in labor. Propoto costs $199. Even if it only saves you half that time, you're still up $4,000. Does that change how you see the price?"

**"We have a tight budget"**
> "Totally understand. Here's the thing — Propoto pays for itself in the first week. If you generate 5 proposals at $199/month, that's $40 per proposal vs. the $600 you're spending now. It's not a cost, it's a 15x return."

**"Can I get a discount?"**
> "Our pricing is straightforward and fair. What I can do is extend your trial to 21 days so you can really test the value. If you're generating proposals daily, the savings will be obvious."

### 4.2 Trust Objections

**"AI can't write as well as us"**
> "You're right that AI alone isn't enough. That's why Propoto uses a specific sales methodology — the Trojan Horse framework — that's proven to convert. Plus, you can edit everything before sending. Think of it as a first draft that's 90% there."

**"What about accuracy/hallucinations?"**
> "Great question. Propoto scrapes the actual prospect's website, so the content is based on real information about their business. We also structure the output so you can review each section. It's a starting point, not a final product."

**"I need to see more examples"**
> "Absolutely. Let's generate 3 proposals right now for real prospects you're working on. You'll see the quality firsthand. If you're not impressed, no hard feelings."

### 4.3 Timing Objections

**"Not the right time"**
> "When would be the right time? [They answer]. What would need to change? [Listen]. Here's what I've seen — agencies who wait are losing deals to competitors who respond faster. Every week you wait is proposals you're not sending."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through? [Listen]. Let me address that right now so you have all the info."

**"I need to talk to my partner"**
> "Totally get it. Can we schedule a 15-minute call with both of you? I'd love to answer their questions directly."

### 4.4 Competition Objections

**"We already use PandaDoc"**
> "PandaDoc is great for sending and signing proposals. But who writes them? That's where Propoto comes in. We're not replacing PandaDoc — we're making it 10x more powerful by generating the content. You can export from Propoto and send via PandaDoc."

**"We just use ChatGPT"**
> "I love that you're already using AI. Here's the difference: ChatGPT gives you generic content. Propoto scrapes the prospect's actual website, uses a proven sales framework, and creates a visual deck automatically. Plus, it remembers your brand voice. Try generating a proposal in ChatGPT vs. Propoto and compare the output."

**"We have templates"**
> "Templates are a great start. But does your template know that your prospect just raised funding? Or that they're hiring for a role that suggests they need exactly what you offer? Propoto personalizes at a level templates can't match."

## 5. Closing Techniques

### 5.1 The Assumptive Close

After the demo, assume the sale:

> "Alright, you've seen how it works. Let's get you set up. I'll send you the trial link — which email should I use for your account?"

### 5.2 The Urgency Close

> "Here's the thing — every day without Propoto is proposals you're either not sending or spending hours on. You've got 14 days free. Why not start saving time today?"

### 5.3 The Summary Close

> "So let me make sure I've got this right: You're sending 15 proposals a month, spending about 4 hours each, and your close rate is around 20%. With Propoto, you could 3x your proposal volume while cutting time by 95%. At $199/month, that's a no-brainer. Ready to start?"

### 5.4 The Risk Reversal

> "Here's my commitment: Try Propoto for 14 days. If you're not sending better proposals in less time, don't pay. No contract, cancel anytime. What do you have to lose?"
