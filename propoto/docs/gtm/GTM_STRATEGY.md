# Propoto GTM Strategy

**Owner:** CEO  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**The Goal:** $500K ARR by December 2026 (12 months)

**The Path:**
- Month 1-3: Validate with 50 paying customers
- Month 4-6: Scale to 100 customers via proven channels
- Month 7-12: Accelerate with content flywheel + partnerships

**The Bet:** Agencies will pay $150/month to generate proposals in 60 seconds instead of 4.5 hours.

---

## 2. Market Entry Strategy

### 2.1 Beachhead Market

**Who:** Digital marketing agencies, 5-30 employees, US-based

**Why this segment:**
- High proposal volume (10-30/month)
- Budget authority (founder/sales director decides)
- Tech-savvy (will adopt AI tools)
- Desperate for time savings (proposal work is non-billable)

**Market Size:** ~12,000 agencies in this segment × $2,400/year = $29M SAM

### 2.2 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Ideal | Acceptable | Avoid |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Company Size** | 10-30 employees | 5-50 employees | <5 or >100 |
| **Proposals/Month** | 15-30 | 10-50 | <5 |
| **Decision Maker** | Founder or Sales Director | Marketing Director | Committee |
| **Current Tools** | Google Docs + Canva | PandaDoc (frustrated) | Custom CRM |
| **Tech Adoption** | Early adopter | Early majority | Laggard |
| **Geography** | US, UK, Canada | Australia, EU | Non-English |

### 2.3 Entry Wedge

**The "Trojan Horse" Demo:**

Instead of cold pitching, we send prospects a *Propoto-generated proposal* about their own business.

> "I made this proposal for your agency in 45 seconds. Want to see how?"

This demonstrates value before the sales conversation even begins.
