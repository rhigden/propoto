## Slide 2: The Problem

**Agencies Are Drowning in Proposal Work**

- Average proposal takes **4.5 hours** to create
- At $150/hour, that's **$675 per proposal**
- Generic templates yield only **8-12% win rates**
- Sales teams burn out on non-billable work

> "I spend 40% of my time on proposals that may never close."
> — Agency Founder, 15 employees

**The Result:** Agencies either send fewer proposals (lost deals) or send generic ones (lower close rates).
