```
[00:00] Hey, this is a bunch of real people
[00:01] making money with AI consulting and
[00:03] automation. I'm going to show you their
[00:04] stories and then dive into some
[00:06] information about how they did so,
[00:07] tactic and strategy. No fluff. Let's get
[00:09] right into it. So, the first is my main
[00:11] man Abb who closed $3,176
[00:14] with a full-time job just 14 days into
[00:17] Maker School. Maker School is my
[00:19] automation community. Obviously, this is
[00:21] going to be kind of a soft pitch for it,
[00:22] but don't pay attention to the community
[00:23] part. Pay attention to his results and
[00:25] how he did it. So what he did was he
[00:27] sent a cold email campaign that achieved
[00:29] a reply rate of 7.9% across almost 1100
[00:32] leads and from that he signed two
[00:35] clients for the 3176.
[00:37] What's interesting is another three or
[00:39] four prospects told him to keep them in
[00:41] the loop for new year and so he's
[00:42] counting that at about 10k pipeline. My
[00:45] big takeaway is I never really count
[00:46] things that are in pipeline as
[00:48] actualized. avoiding that still 3,176
[00:51] bucks. And the tactic was use LinkedIn
[00:55] Sales Navigator, which offered a free
[00:57] trial to generate a list of leads
[01:00] instantly, which is a cold email
[01:01] platform to send to those leads. GPT40
[01:05] Mini to generate customized ice breakers
[01:08] so that those leads thought that this
[01:09] outreach was hyperpersonalized.
[01:11] Exa AI for browsing and getting web
[01:14] context about these people. Just five
[01:16] bucks for a,000 websites. any
[01:18] Mailfinder, which he purchased the
[01:19] 10,000 credit plan of. Then finally, he
[01:22] has a free trial hack for another
[01:24] platform here, Phantom Buster. Don't
[01:25] know what he's doing there, but
[01:26] apparently that allowed him to download
[01:28] a lot of leads. So, uh, main takeaways
[01:31] from his words, he's saying, "Treat cold
[01:34] email leads like gold." I mean, cold
[01:35] email leads are typically pretty
[01:37] skeptical. They don't know who you are,
[01:38] and so you really do have to win over
[01:40] their attention at every step. But if
[01:41] you're good at doing this, like Abb, if
[01:43] you reply fast, follow up and don't let
[01:45] them go cold, you can also achieve a
[01:47] very high reply rate and then good
[01:49] results. He's sharing some Stripe
[01:51] screenshots, a screenshot of his
[01:53] instantly dashboard with almost 53.5%
[01:56] positive. Uh some information just about
[01:58] how to structure the thing that we
[01:59] helped him through and then some more
[02:01] info from the actual prospect. We're a
[02:03] 1250 setup fee. It looks like a 1250
[02:06] delivery with some other stuff as well.
[02:07] Second major win was Dr. Samantha North.
[02:10] Now, Samantha is both a doctor and also
[02:13] extraordinarily good at what she does.
[02:15] So, as opposed to going outbound, which
[02:16] is what I usually recommend, she went
[02:18] inbound. Essentially, she created a tiny
[02:20] YouTube channel on AI and automation.
[02:22] Let me just give her a little shout out
[02:24] here cuz she's doing such a great job.
[02:25] She's absolutely crushing it. Um, she
[02:27] talks about a variety of things,
[02:28] essentially AI strategy for founders.
[02:31] And she publishes videos here. As you
[02:32] can see, she's got a modest subscriber
[02:34] count at 240. From what I can tell, and
[02:36] I've watched a couple of these now, her
[02:38] videos are pretty well thought out. She
[02:39] goes deep into details and it's like
[02:41] tactical actionable based similar to
[02:43] some of the content that I make. And
[02:44] essentially she posts these videos,
[02:46] right? And then down below after giving
[02:48] away a bunch of free value, she just has
[02:50] a calendar link. If you click on this
[02:52] calendar link, then you can book a time
[02:54] with her. And then she'll ask you a
[02:55] bunch of questions, you know, LinkedIn
[02:57] profile, company name, company website,
[02:59] all this stuff, which essentially just
[03:00] helps her like close you better. She
[03:02] knows a little bit more about your
[03:03] business. You can spend more time on the
[03:05] call actually focusing on needs. And uh
[03:07] yeah, that's that's how she does it. So
[03:08] essentially what happened was she made a
[03:10] bunch of these YouTube videos over the
[03:11] course of several months it looks like
[03:13] and she closed a 5,000 great British
[03:15] pound project. I think that's equivalent
[03:17] to like 6,500 USD entirely from YouTube.
[03:20] Now some takeaways here. Um when you do
[03:22] inbound, okay, prospects tend to just
[03:25] naturally like you because they just
[03:27] spent who knows 5 10 minutes maybe even
[03:29] like an hour consuming your content. So
[03:31] they genuinely like you. You're also
[03:33] positioned as an authority, right?
[03:34] because somebody is coming to you and
[03:36] then um odds are this person knows what
[03:39] they want. Now, if you contrast that
[03:41] with um inbound to outbound, rather
[03:45] outbound, which is typically what I
[03:46] recommend, you know, the person
[03:48] inherently has no idea who you are. So,
[03:50] they're very skeptical. You have to
[03:53] build your proof. Okay? If you don't
[03:56] have um any sort of social proof or
[03:59] whatever, it's going to be very very
[04:00] tough to go. And then a lot of the time
[04:02] they have zero clue what they want. So
[04:04] obviously inbound is preferable for a
[04:07] lot of people because they're like,
[04:08] "Well, I don't really like sales calls.
[04:10] I don't really like having to, you know,
[04:11] build up all my authority and and and
[04:13] disavow their skepticism and show them
[04:15] value and stuff like that. I much rather
[04:16] just like create YouTube videos from the
[04:18] comfort of my own home." The unfortunate
[04:20] reality is this just tends to take a lot
[04:22] longer and so I only recommend it to
[04:23] people that are already established
[04:24] business owners that have already had
[04:25] some established wins. So Dr. Samantha
[04:27] North here already had some established
[04:29] wins. That's what she did. She took her
[04:31] wins from outbound and from building
[04:32] projects for other people on platforms
[04:33] like Upwork and so on and so forth. And
[04:35] then she brought that over to YouTube
[04:36] and used her skill in order to land that
[04:38] deal. This is something that anybody
[04:39] here can do that has that requisite
[04:41] knowledge. Now Jotty over here signed
[04:43] $31,000 worth of a retainer. He took his
[04:46] MR from $8,000 to $18,000 for the next 3
[04:50] months. A little over 3 months. I think
[04:51] it's about 10K a month. And essentially
[04:53] what he's doing is he's working as a
[04:56] Salesforce product owner. Salesforce
[04:58] being a particular CRM for from my
[05:00] understanding um academic publishing
[05:02] companies. So academic publishing
[05:04] companies are pretty big. They're
[05:05] definitely up mid-market. Uh and so
[05:07] these businesses typically use CRM that
[05:09] are a little bit broader in nature, a
[05:11] little bit more all-encompassing things
[05:12] like HubSpot, Salesforce, and other
[05:14] enterprise level CRM. Now, the way that
[05:16] Jotty did this from my understanding is
[05:18] he went up my warmth ladder. Okay? And
[05:21] if you don't know what the warmth ladder
[05:23] is, essentially at the very top of the
[05:24] ladder are the warmest prospects that
[05:26] you've ever met. These are people that
[05:27] you've already worked with in some
[05:29] capacity, but people that are directly
[05:31] in your network and and so you pitch
[05:33] them. Um, down over here you have your
[05:35] okay leads and then down over here you
[05:37] have your cold leads. Essentially what
[05:39] you do with the warmth ladder is you
[05:40] always just start top to bottom and you
[05:42] pitch to people that you already know
[05:44] that already like and trust you that
[05:46] already have some sort of pre-existing
[05:47] relationship with you. Jotty is a PhD
[05:49] student from my understanding um
[05:51] somewhere in Switzerland I believe or
[05:52] maybe Geneva if I'm butchering you
[05:53] Jotty. So sorry about that. But to make
[05:55] a long story short, he's already very
[05:57] intertwined with kind of that whole
[05:59] network, he has a bunch of contacts that
[06:00] are in academic publishing. And so for
[06:02] him, you know, as somebody that's
[06:03] starting this AI automation consulting
[06:06] sort of career, uh for him, the
[06:08] straightest line path was just to go to
[06:09] everybody in his network and pitch them
[06:11] on, you know, hey, can I assist you with
[06:13] X, Y, and Z, CRM, project management
[06:15] systems, AI systems, and so on and so
[06:17] forth. Now, typically what happens is
[06:19] you only have a few people in your
[06:20] network that are actual um good
[06:21] candidates for this. So once you're done
[06:23] with this, you then have to move down to
[06:24] the okay people on the warmth ladder.
[06:26] That's kind of the mid rung. People that
[06:28] you know maybe you've pitched in the
[06:29] past that haven't necessarily said yes.
[06:31] So these are past leads, past contacts,
[06:33] people that are like roughly in your
[06:34] network but not necessarily like
[06:36] firstderee connections, maybe seconds or
[06:38] thirds. And then after you're done with
[06:39] that, what job is going to do is go 100%
[06:41] cold and essentially run a system like
[06:44] um Abbec was doing earlier. Anoir
[06:46] crushed an Upwork project for $7,500
[06:49] upfront plus $1,200 a month. This is a
[06:52] simple accounts receivable automation
[06:53] system. What's really interesting about
[06:55] Anoir's story is the offer came in the
[06:57] day before he flew out for a Caribbean
[06:59] cruise. So, I mean, he almost pulled out
[07:01] of the deal because he figured, you
[07:02] know, this cruise is going to take up a
[07:03] lot of his time and he wouldn't be able
[07:05] to fulfill it and whatever. But, um,
[07:07] because of the advice presumably a bunch
[07:09] of people in the community and, you
[07:10] know, just the general mindset of it
[07:11] all, he decided to go all in. He
[07:13] negotiated the deal, closed it, and then
[07:15] actually started the build while on the
[07:17] ocean. So, half work, half holiday, he
[07:19] says. He caps it off with some lessons
[07:21] learned. Mainly that there is no perfect
[07:23] time that you can learn while doing that
[07:26] volume wins, one yes changes everything
[07:28] and that action kills doubt. And
[07:29] essentially the strategy here is he uses
[07:31] a platform called Upwork which is a
[07:34] freelancing kind of gig platform.
[07:36] Interested people that are looking for
[07:38] hires or roles to be filled will post
[07:39] jobs on these. He then searches for
[07:41] terms like automation, uh, you know,
[07:45] accounting, whatever his specific fields
[07:47] of expertise are. And then he just sends
[07:49] apps and he sends a lot of apps. As you
[07:52] said, as he said right over here, volume
[07:54] wins. It only takes one yes to change
[07:55] everything. I think $7,500 is a build
[07:58] fee. A lot of people here could probably
[08:00] understand how that could change
[08:01] somebody's life, especially if they're
[08:02] at the start of their career. So, if he
[08:04] can close a $7,500 job and a retainer
[08:06] from a ship in the Caribbean, anyone
[08:08] can. Trey closed a $1,000 payday by
[08:10] upselling a previous client of his.
[08:12] Essentially, this was a Many Chat make
[08:14] to Beehive to CRM integration system.
[08:17] He's also doing newsletter redesigns.
[08:18] And then he has an AI email
[08:20] autoresponder for the newsletter just
[08:22] thanking people for signing up and that
[08:23] sort of stuff. So, he published his
[08:25] little little Stripe screenshot here and
[08:26] then some information. Uh, essentially
[08:29] what I love about this is a lot of
[08:31] people think that once they sign up a
[08:32] client, that's it. They've made the
[08:33] money off of said client. But the vast
[08:35] majority of the money that you will make
[08:37] in any business, not just an AI
[08:38] consulting business, is in retained
[08:41] relationships. So relationships where a
[08:42] client pays you more over time. Uh what
[08:45] I mean by this is anytime you acquire a
[08:47] new client, you always have to pay what
[08:49] are called an acquisition costs. Okay?
[08:51] So you guys have probably seen this as a
[08:52] cost to acquire a customer, customer
[08:54] acquisition cost, CAC, something like
[08:55] that. But basically what that means is
[08:57] let's say Trey just closed $1,000
[08:59] upfront and that's all he closed. He
[09:01] probably spent a little bit of money to
[09:02] do that. And sometimes you could spend a
[09:03] fair amount of money. Maybe he got the
[09:05] client through uh cold email like Aboc
[09:07] or Upwork or even YouTube or something.
[09:09] You can conceptualize the time you spend
[09:10] on YouTube as sort of a customer
[09:11] acquisition cost, right? Well, that
[09:13] means the very first deal you get from a
[09:15] customer, you're not actually making
[09:16] that full $1,000. You're actually only
[09:18] making $850. The cool thing about Trey
[09:20] is by adding on, okay, an additional
[09:23] $1,000.
[09:25] Now, what he's doing is it's $2,000
[09:28] minus150. Meaning his actual total
[09:30] takeaway is 1,850, not 850. And if you
[09:33] do the math, what is 850 as a fraction
[09:36] of 2,000 versus 850 as a fraction of
[09:40] 1,000? Well, mathematically, this over
[09:44] here is 92.5% margin. This over here is
[09:47] 85% margin. So, what that means is every
[09:50] additional $1,000 deal increases Trey's
[09:53] total margin, making his business more
[09:55] profitable. And then ultimately more
[09:57] enjoyable, too, because you tend to
[09:59] enjoy working with people that you've
[10:00] already worked with more than working
[10:02] with a totally random new person that
[10:03] you've never worked with that doesn't
[10:05] understand your boundaries and doesn't
[10:06] have like a good uh uh you know, rhythm
[10:08] or cadence. So, to make a long story
[10:11] short, um Trey closed a $1,000 payday.
[10:13] He is no stranger to work. He's saying
[10:15] it should be between 15 to 20 hours of
[10:17] work. So, don't get me wrong, this isn't
[10:19] free money falling from the sky, but
[10:20] it's a good example of how you can take
[10:22] a pre-existing relationship and you can
[10:23] offer them more value. And in fact,
[10:25] using the warmth ladder analogy from
[10:27] Jotty, that's usually my recommendation.
[10:29] Ethan locked in his third client last
[10:31] week. Really funny. He said, "When I
[10:32] started my company, I told my wife, if I
[10:34] can get my first paying client in 6
[10:36] months, I'll keep going." He's 2 months
[10:38] in, he's already got three. So, this man
[10:39] is also clearly no stranger to hard
[10:41] work. Um the specific deal is he's
[10:44] organizing QuickBooks data then building
[10:46] out a customer retention automation. So
[10:48] this could be quite sophisticated or
[10:51] quite simple depends on how Ethan scoped
[10:52] this project. I do not know more about
[10:54] that so I can't comment but $1,200 to
[10:57] set up and then a monthly uh $150
[11:01] to maintain the automation. This is kind
[11:04] of interesting. Essentially, if you're a
[11:05] good builder, um you will rarely be
[11:08] asked to do any sort of upgrades or a
[11:10] maintenance or you'll rarely ever need
[11:12] to fix a workflow that's broken the
[11:13] simpler that it is. So, this sort of
[11:15] play, while I don't usually recommend
[11:17] charging retainers that are less than
[11:18] a,000 bucks or so, can work. If he has
[11:20] 10 clients on this, he's making an
[11:22] additional $1,500 a month. What's the
[11:24] probability that one of these super
[11:25] simple, straightforward three or four
[11:27] node automations fails in a month?
[11:29] Assuming that, you know, you're good at
[11:30] building, you've set up uh all of your
[11:32] data to be sanitized as it comes in,
[11:34] there's no misunderstandings with the
[11:36] client, and you're using dependencies
[11:37] that don't typically um you know, go out
[11:39] of service or uh or or have usage
[11:40] issues. Pretty low, right? So, you can
[11:42] make a fair amount of money off the top.
[11:44] What I do like about offering some sort
[11:45] of maintenance retainer is it just keeps
[11:48] you in the loop and it keeps you uh
[11:50] coordinating with that client. So, when
[11:51] the time comes to upsell them on a
[11:53] project that's not $150 a month, but
[11:55] maybe $15,000 a month or something like
[11:57] that, you have an in. As I've mentioned,
[11:59] upselling and retaining is always faster
[12:02] and easier money than acquiring totally
[12:03] new clientele. So, Ethan acquired this
[12:05] one through Upwork. Obviously, he's
[12:07] doing very well. It's a very simple and
[12:08] straightforward path. I'm not going to
[12:10] say it's easy to do this work, but it is
[12:12] straightforward, and that's more than
[12:13] can be said for most industries. Marcos
[12:15] went from 700 bucks to $3,200 in 60
[12:19] days. Essentially, in the first two
[12:20] weeks of November, he hit 3,200 in
[12:22] revenue, whereas 60 days ago, he was at
[12:24] between 500 to 700 bucks. Um, he's
[12:26] calling it a six times jump. It is
[12:28] approximately six times. And the main
[12:30] reason he thinks that it has occurred is
[12:31] because he's charged a lot more. I would
[12:33] agree with him here. I happened to get
[12:34] on a call with Marcos about 6 months
[12:36] into his program. He took a couple
[12:38] months off. He wasn't entirely, you
[12:39] know, consistent and accountable. and he
[12:41] ran me through some of his past deals.
[12:43] And we realized that the vast majority
[12:45] of the deals that he had acquired up
[12:47] until that point were to the tune of a
[12:48] couple of hundred dollars each, which is
[12:50] obviously not a very sustainable pricing
[12:52] model. I mean, that puts his hourly rate
[12:53] at like five bucks, something like that.
[12:55] So, I told him that one of the quickest
[12:56] and easiest ways to make more money is
[12:58] literally just to charge more for the
[12:59] same work. I know it sounds silly, but
[13:02] um a lot of people think about this in
[13:04] terms of supply and demand, right? And
[13:06] so in microeconomics, if the supply is
[13:09] high, that means there is a lot of um
[13:12] available offer, then the demand, aka
[13:14] the price that you can charge for a
[13:16] service is very low. And so because
[13:18] people are new to this, because they
[13:19] spend all their time on the internet,
[13:20] not actually talking to real customers,
[13:22] they think that the supply of other
[13:24] people that are doing what they are
[13:25] doing is super mega high, meaning they
[13:27] have to charge very little because the
[13:29] demand is very low, right? The reality
[13:31] is 90% of people have no idea what's
[13:33] possible with even technology 10 years
[13:35] ago. They simply are so focused on doing
[13:38] the work of their business that they
[13:39] haven't pulled their head out of the
[13:40] sand to see how much the world has
[13:42] changed. And so this supply side is a
[13:44] lot smaller than you think. You could
[13:46] literally just charge more money and
[13:49] triple demand, okay? And you'll make
[13:52] somewhere between two to three times
[13:54] more money because it's not like a
[13:56] onetoone relationship between how much
[13:57] you charge and how many people say yes
[13:58] to you. So, what I'm trying to say is a
[14:00] lot of people have the perception that
[14:01] they need to charge bottom barrel rates
[14:03] even on platforms like Upwork or through
[14:04] cold email just because they live on the
[14:06] internet. Uh, some kid a little while
[14:08] ago told me to touch grass. So, that's
[14:10] some Gen Z slang that I think probably
[14:13] makes sense to a lot of people that are
[14:14] listening. If you just go and touch
[14:16] grass, you realize that the size of the
[14:17] opportunity and the scope of it is a lot
[14:18] bigger than most people think. And the
[14:20] number of people that understand how to
[14:21] implement these sorts of technologies is
[14:22] a lot smaller than most people think.
[14:24] So, what this means is let's say you
[14:26] charge three times more. Okay? If you
[14:28] charge three times more, you will not
[14:30] reduce your conversion rate by three.
[14:33] This does not mean your conversion rate
[14:35] CVR is cut in 1/3. Realistically, if you
[14:39] charge three times more, you might cut
[14:41] your CVR by, I don't know, two or
[14:43] something like that. Which means if you
[14:45] had five deals previously paying you 2K
[14:48] a month, okay, hypothetically, that's
[14:50] 10K in total. You could literally just
[14:53] charge more or triple your prices
[14:55] hypothetically to 6K. And it's not like
[14:57] you'd get uh proportionally the same
[14:59] amount of money. You would probably get
[15:01] three * 6K
[15:04] and you'd make 18K a month. This is for
[15:06] a variety of reasons. I'm not going to
[15:08] get into all of them, but one, a lot of
[15:10] the time people just don't really trust
[15:11] you if you don't charge enough money to
[15:12] get them excited and serious about
[15:13] something. There's a certain amount of
[15:15] commitment that people need to provide
[15:16] to a service provider in order to get
[15:18] them excited enough about the thing to
[15:20] follow through on their promises. And a
[15:22] lot of the time if you're charging, you
[15:23] know, a retainer that's, oh gosh, I
[15:25] don't know, like $200 a month or
[15:26] something like that for some big
[15:27] intensive service, which I see all the
[15:29] time in maker school from people that
[15:30] are well-intentioned but not very um
[15:32] capable or competent just yet. Clients
[15:34] will just say no to that at face value
[15:36] because they'll realize that you're not
[15:37] a competent service provider. They'll be
[15:38] like, "Are you kidding me? This guy
[15:39] wants to charge me $200 a month. He's
[15:41] probably never worked with anybody in
[15:42] his life. I'm not going to work with
[15:43] him. I'm going to go pay the other guy
[15:45] 2K a month." I mean just the very uh
[15:48] mention of the fact that you're willing
[15:49] to work for that little pay disqualifies
[15:51] you and discredits you. So that's one
[15:52] way. There variety of other ones.
[15:54] Typically when you charge higher you
[15:55] just work with better people and better
[15:56] people require less time to manage and
[15:58] so you can typically just scale up your
[16:00] prices, work with more
[16:03] make way more money simply as a
[16:04] byproduct of having enough time and then
[16:06] you can deliver higher quality services
[16:08] and so on and so forth. Um but to make a
[16:10] long story short, he just charged more.
[16:12] Then he also leveled up the actual
[16:13] skill. One big issue with him was he
[16:15] didn't really believe in his ability to
[16:16] sell um which I think was in his case
[16:18] the delivery of a cold email system.
[16:20] Right. Yeah, that's right. So, he just
[16:23] got really good at doing cold email. He
[16:24] basically like upskilled, read a bunch
[16:26] of copywriting books, improved his list
[16:27] building, improved his targeting, the
[16:29] whole outbound stack. Then instead of
[16:30] charging $200, looks like he charged
[16:33] five times more. So, he closed a $1,000
[16:35] setup. So, I mean, like, you know, is
[16:37] Marcos taking over the world with this
[16:38] $3,200 60 days? No, obviously not. But
[16:41] how inspiring is this for an
[16:42] entrepreneur that just could not make it
[16:44] past charging more than a couple hundred
[16:45] bucks for a service? Insane. Truid over
[16:48] here signed an $8,500 contract. It was
[16:51] for a small CPA firm that wanted to
[16:53] automate their client reporting and tax
[16:54] projection process. So Truit started
[16:56] sending out Upwork applications
[16:58] basically from day one when he got into
[16:59] um Maker School our program. And he got
[17:01] in touch with them a really really long
[17:02] time ago. But then he sent them a pitch
[17:04] and then they ghosted him, moved on. two
[17:07] weeks ago after so many months
[17:10] essentially they got back to him and
[17:11] said hey you know this is something
[17:12] that's still on our radar we want to
[17:13] move forward then he closed the hell out
[17:14] of it okay so another big limiting
[17:17] belief here is the outreach that you do
[17:19] today only works for today in reality
[17:23] what happens is if you're sending some
[17:25] campaign on anything whether it's Upwork
[17:27] or cold email or or or something else
[17:29] okay if you have a 1% reply rate today
[17:33] and you sent that thing today tomorrow
[17:36] you might have a 2% % reply rate. Why?
[17:38] Because a lot of people are, as that Gen
[17:40] Z kid so eloquently explained to me,
[17:42] touching grass. They're not just in the
[17:43] office all the time. So, there's always
[17:45] some lag. And the longer time you give
[17:48] yourself, okay, between when you first
[17:50] um, you know, maybe send out a campaign
[17:52] and then when you evaluate its results,
[17:53] typically the better the results are
[17:55] going to be. And so this lag between
[17:56] input and output is why a lot of people
[17:58] iterate too quickly and they iterate
[17:59] themselves out of a meaningful approach.
[18:01] Like if your priors if your fundamental
[18:03] assumptions are correct then there is no
[18:06] reason why you should not continue
[18:07] putting in effort if you believe those
[18:09] priors are correct because it's simply a
[18:11] matter of market lag. Yes, your priors
[18:13] are correct. Yes, statistically
[18:14] speaking, you know, people will get back
[18:16] to you. Right now, you're just being
[18:17] caught in the noise. So, if that is you,
[18:19] keep on digging until you find those
[18:21] damn gems. Seth has a hell of a case
[18:24] study. He closed $12,700
[18:26] in one afternoon. To make a long story
[18:29] short, um a government shutdown pushed a
[18:31] project that he was doing for his day
[18:32] job into the new year. That gave him a
[18:34] bunch more time, somebody else that's
[18:35] working a full-time job. They ended up
[18:37] sending 12 applications on Upwork,
[18:40] booking eight calls and qualifying five.
[18:42] So, two were straightforward one-offs at
[18:43] a,000 bucks each. The other three wanted
[18:45] retainers, but opted for a first project
[18:47] to gauge fit. They came in hourly, a
[18:49] little over 2k total. He then moved fast
[18:51] on delivery to learn the ongoing work.
[18:53] Now, during that period of time, he then
[18:55] closed $3,200 a month. These were
[18:57] internal audits with a focus on
[18:58] identifying Hierroi automation. So,
[19:00] these were AI audits that he was doing
[19:02] before even building. He then made
[19:04] almost $3,200 plus a $2,600 a month
[19:08] retainer from his first client on
[19:09] Upwork. And now he's doing a variety of
[19:11] other deals. But essentially, it took
[19:13] him to 12.7K. And what he's now doing is
[19:16] he's starting to um dive into cold email
[19:19] and LinkedIn DMs because we're seeing a
[19:21] lot of people crush it with LinkedIn DMs
[19:23] in the community. This is a great
[19:24] example of how um you can bootstrap
[19:26] yourself from basically zero. Not
[19:28] actually zero because he had a day job
[19:30] which financed this which is fantastic.
[19:31] It's a good spot to be in. By the way,
[19:33] if you don't have any money, don't try
[19:35] doing something like this. Go get
[19:36] yourself some freaking oxygen first.
[19:38] Okay? That's what cash is. Cash allows
[19:40] you to pull your head out from
[19:41] underwater, take a deep breath, and then
[19:43] actually like see where the hell you're
[19:44] going. Um you know, there's nothing
[19:46] wrong with having a job. When I was an
[19:48] entrepreneur in my early uh couple of
[19:50] years in my career, I always had this
[19:52] pride thing. I had to start my own
[19:53] business and I couldn't work for the man
[19:55] because that would make me lesser or
[19:56] something. Dude, I would have been so
[19:58] much further ahead if I had just like
[19:59] ate that ego and then work for the man
[20:01] because I would have had so much money
[20:02] that I could have used to spend on a
[20:04] variety of things like outreach tools,
[20:06] like infrastructure for my campaigns,
[20:08] like Upwork apps, and so on and so
[20:09] forth. Anyway, side note, this is a a
[20:12] great limiting belief breaker cuz Seth
[20:14] basically took his business from zero to
[20:16] $12,700.
[20:19] And now what he's doing is he's taking a
[20:21] portion of this and I don't know how
[20:22] much. My recommendation is take maybe
[20:24] 15%. Then he's going to divert it over
[20:26] to growth. And you know if you do the
[20:28] math on that that's um I don't know
[20:29] probably like 1.6k. Do you know how much
[20:32] growth you could buy with 1.6k for
[20:34] starting from zero. I mean the average
[20:36] Upwork application takes somewhere
[20:38] between $2 to $3 right now if you factor
[20:40] in the fact that um if you do a boost or
[20:42] a bid then the connects don't actually
[20:44] get spent. Um, average cold emails, a
[20:47] single mailbox is something like three
[20:50] bucks a month right now and can send 900
[20:54] a month. That's 900 potential people
[20:56] that you're getting in contact with for
[20:57] $3 a month. You have to buy some domains
[20:59] and obviously software, but I mean
[21:00] that's the scale of leverage we're
[21:02] talking about here. There are a lot of
[21:03] communities out there you can join for
[21:04] like $50 or $100 a month that now give
[21:07] you massive access to a huge group of
[21:09] people that are just like on their hands
[21:10] and knees begging for somebody more
[21:11] competent to come in and solve it. you
[21:13] could easily jump in there, build
[21:14] authority, and then sell whatever the
[21:16] heck you want. And this is exactly what
[21:18] you should be doing if you find some
[21:20] initial success. Drew here, who's going
[21:22] by Lumio, um crushed almost $50,000 in 5
[21:25] months. Now, he did this primarily
[21:27] through Discord groups. He joined Iman
[21:29] Gazi's Discord, didn't find much help
[21:31] there. But what he did find was a
[21:33] surplus of people who want small tasks
[21:35] completed like designs, websites,
[21:36] automations, editing. And essentially,
[21:38] he reached out to a bunch of people just
[21:40] on the Discord through freaking Discord
[21:42] DMs, which by the way, you could also do
[21:44] in school. You could do it on any other
[21:45] community platform, and got a client
[21:47] that was more or less a money printer
[21:49] where he manages this whole platform for
[21:50] voice agents and CRM. What I love about
[21:53] this is the self-awareness. He went to
[21:54] college for 3 years, made basically no
[21:56] money, and the first moment he got his
[21:58] client through a Discord, everything
[21:59] changed. Okay, he currently uh has
[22:01] secured eight clients. He's currently
[22:03] working with four. Okay, highest paying
[22:04] clients at $8,000 a month. Totally
[22:07] reasonable. Doesn't matter how many
[22:08] years you go to college if you're
[22:09] learning a skill set that's outdated,
[22:11] right? But you can go in with just a
[22:13] couple of months, focus that learning on
[22:15] ways to drive revenue through like
[22:17] actionable daily um outbound activities
[22:19] and so on and so forth. And you can make
[22:20] more money than you would have been in
[22:22] 30 years in school. Nay is now at
[22:24] $10,000 a month. He said he'd do it in
[22:26] three months. He did it in five. Kudos
[22:28] to him for aiming high. But essentially,
[22:30] he also did this while keeping another
[22:31] job. So, it's not just 10 grand a month
[22:33] this fell is making now. It's presumably
[22:35] significantly more than that. Even takes
[22:37] a screenshot of his Mercury balance. So,
[22:38] Mercury is just a bank account in the
[22:40] United States that shows 10 gzen. And
[22:42] it's really big stuff because NIS joined
[22:44] on June the 8th and has since literally
[22:47] published like a dayby-day kind of
[22:50] memorandum of everything that he's
[22:52] doing. I mean like he started off having
[22:54] absolutely no idea how the hell Google
[22:56] workspace worked or what IMAP was. He
[22:58] had no idea what go High Level was. He
[23:00] asked a bunch of questions about
[23:02] automation. Then he talked about, you
[23:03] know, setting up ManyHad for the first
[23:05] times and so on and so forth. And since
[23:07] then, he's gone through and massively
[23:09] leveled himself up. He started hiring
[23:10] from the community. I mean, he's he's
[23:12] absolutely crushing it. No doubt in my
[23:13] mind, this man's destined for $100,000 a
[23:15] month or more. What I like about that
[23:17] and just what I like about the community
[23:18] models in general is you can actually
[23:20] just see over time like people's
[23:22] progress like they join some group and
[23:24] then because they store their post
[23:26] history. You literally see the very
[23:27] first post somebody made and you can see
[23:28] them like stumbling around in darkness
[23:30] reaching out for help but but but moving
[23:32] right like but actually pushing and then
[23:34] you could see how they put various
[23:36] pieces together. You could see the the
[23:38] beginnings and emergences of their first
[23:40] wins all the way to today. So, super
[23:42] motivational stuff and I hope Nissa
[23:44] continues to crush as well as he's doing
[23:45] right now. Last mention, obligatory from
[23:48] Azim. This was $11,000 in 29 days as a
[23:51] high school student. Azim is no stranger
[23:53] to AI and automations. He's published a
[23:56] bunch of YouTube videos on the subject.
[23:57] He has like a modestly sized channel.
[23:59] Um, but things really started working
[24:01] for him when he applied principles of
[24:02] daily accountability. He says he spent 6
[24:05] months failing uh $3,000 in investment
[24:07] as a high school student. man, just
[24:09] zooming out a little bit, like spending
[24:11] six months as a high school student
[24:12] failing and then winning is incredible.
[24:14] I spent like two years as a young adult
[24:17] failing and even then I didn't win to
[24:18] this degree. He's been doing a variety
[24:20] of different approaches. Um, key for him
[24:21] has been this YouTube channel of his
[24:23] which he started publishing videos on
[24:24] how to do NADN builds and how to build
[24:26] AI agents and stuff like that very very
[24:28] early on. What a great skill to
[24:29] cultivate at the age of 16 years old,
[24:31] huh? From there, you know, he landed
[24:32] some initial introductory clients from a
[24:34] variety of communities. He's since
[24:36] focused heavily on referrals,
[24:37] network-based sales. Um, he can't go on
[24:40] Upwork, which is the main platform that
[24:41] a lot of people here get their first
[24:43] zero to one with, probably at least 60%.
[24:45] Because he's under 18 and he's taken
[24:47] this not as a blocker, but as a
[24:49] challenge. And so, instead, he's taken
[24:50] it upon himself to become an expert at
[24:52] cold email. So, he's spinning up all
[24:54] these mailboxes, he's pushing, very,
[24:56] very, very motivational. His goal is to
[24:58] hit over $50,000 a month before December
[25:00] the 31st or I'll have to do something
[25:02] crazy. I do wonder what that crazy thing
[25:04] is, but suffice to say, I wish we all
[25:06] had your nuts at the age of 16, buddy.
[25:08] Congratulations. Okay, hopefully you
[25:10] guys got some nuggets from this video. I
[25:12] want to shout out everybody that is in
[25:13] Maker School, anybody that is
[25:15] considering joining Maker School, and
[25:16] everybody that has put so much effort
[25:18] into ensuring not only their future, but
[25:21] also increasing the station of their
[25:22] families uh and the people around them.
[25:24] This technology is extraordinarily
[25:26] transformative and essentially over the
[25:28] course of the next few years as it is
[25:30] distributed more and more and more to
[25:31] people the people that are doing the
[25:33] distributing aka the companies that are
[25:34] implementing these things to small and
[25:36] mid-size businesses will continue
[25:37] winning. So yeah, just really stoked uh
[25:39] to even like have access to this
[25:40] information and be in such a group. If
[25:42] you guys have any questions about how to
[25:44] do stuff like this yourself, feel free
[25:45] to drop a comment down below. I'm more
[25:46] than happy to help and I'm sourcing
[25:48] ideas for next YouTube video. Uh, thank
[25:49] you very much for watching and hopefully
[25:51] you guys take at least one piece of
[25:53] information away from this towards your
[25:55] goals.
